# Dependency Management

A cloud-native application must be self-contained, where everything needed to run the application is contained within a single build artifact. Applications can no longer assume that a server will have everything they need. Instead, applications need to bring their dependencies with them.

E.g., never rely on the implicit existence of system-wide packages, or facilities like the Global Assembly Cache.

!!! tip "Repeatable deployments"
    Managing application dependencies is all about repeatable deployments.

    {==Nothing about the runtime into which an application is deployed should be assumed that isnâ€™t automated. -- huh? ==}

## Kubernetes

Fortunately, it is relatively easy for the container to include all of the dependencies on which the application relies, and provide a reasonably isolated environment in which the container runs. {==(container environments are not completely isolated, but for most situations, they are Good Enough.)==}

For applications that are modularized and depend on other components, Kubernetes provides a way to combine all of these pieces into a single Pod, for an environment that encapsulates those pieces appropriately.
