# API First

Regardless of the type of application, the ultimate goal might very well be to have that application be a participant in an ecosystem of services.

Even if, at the outset, the service is not a part of a larger ecosystem, the discipline of starting development at the API level still pays enough dividends to make it worth the effort.

When building cloud-native applications, chances are another team in the organization starts building services relying on your code. Soon multiple teams are building services with horizontal dependencies that are all on a different release cadence.

To avoid integration failures, API first gives teams the ability to work against each otherâ€™s public contracts without interfering with internal development processes.

If we treat and develop all applications as [backing services](/backing-services), and designed them API-first; the system will be free to grow, adapt to new load and demand, and accommodate new consumers without having to re-architect yet another closed system.
