# Administrative Processes

[Stateless processes](/stateless-processes) runs regular business applications (such as handling web requests).

Separately, developers will often wish to do one-off administrative or maintenance tasks for the application, such as:

* Database migrations
* Running timed scripts, such as a nightly batch job or hourly import
* Running a one-off job that executes custom code only once

All of which should probably not be a part of the regular business application. Always consider whether an administrative process is what you want, or whether a different design or architecture would better suit your needs.

- **Avoid timers**

    Internalized timers that perform batch operations may look appealing on the surface, but it might not scale when there are multiple instances of the application running. If theyâ€™re all performing the same batch operation, this might also lead to corrupt or duplicate data.

- **Use telemetry**

    Do not rely on interactive shells, remote desktop, ssh, and even kubectl for in-process introspection, instead use [Telemetry](/telemetry) to cover more aspects of application monitoring.

- **Timed administrative batch processes**

    Consider exposing a RESTful endpoint that can be used to invoke ad hoc functionality, or alternatively, extract the batch-related code from the main application and create a separate application.

    Either will allow at-will invocation of timed functionality, but it moves the stimuli outside the application, while also solving the at most once execution problem that internal timers have on dynamically scaled instances.
